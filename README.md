# Workshop
Accompanying code for DGM Workshop "Introduction to Machine Learning for Material Scientists" at DGM Nachwuchsformum Kassel.

## Abstract 
Machine learning tools like ChatGPT and Midjourney are extremely popular right now. But how does a neural network actually work and how can we benefit from it in materials science? In this workshop we program our own simple neural network for image classification and learn some machine learning basics on the way. Afterwards we will discuss some more recent applications in materials science and engineering. 

Please bring your own computer to actively participate in the workshop. 

## Preparation
We will use Python and Jupyter Notebooks during the workshop. Some basic instructions for setting up the environment on your computer and basic Python syntax is given in the `python_basics.ipynb` notebook. Alternatively, you may use Binder (hit the button `Launch Binder` and wait a few moments) to interactively participate in the workshop using your browser only.
